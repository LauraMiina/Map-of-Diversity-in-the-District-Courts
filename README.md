# Map of District Court Diversity
 Creating an interactive map that shows the level of diversity among the District Court Judges. This project was a part of a Fall 2023 Data & Databases course at Columbia Journalism School.
 The objective of this project was to create a journalistically relevant database and visualisation about the diveristy of District Courts around the United States. It involved scraping data from several sites, creating a dataframe of that data, analyzing it and bringing to the map.
 The end result of the project can be seen here: https://lauramiina.github.io/diversity-district-courts/
